# AlmaBetter Capstone Project 3 - Classification : Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
This project is a part of the AlmaBetter Premium Program , Banglore/Bengaluru ,Karnataka , India

-- Project Status: [Completed]

# Problem Description :
This project is aimed at predicting the case of customers default payments in Taiwan. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. We can use the K-S chart to evaluate which customers will default on their credit card payments.

# What is credit card default?
Credit card default happens when you have become severely delinquent on your credit card payments. Default is a serious credit card status that affects not only your standing with that credit card issuer but also your credit standing in general and your ability to get approved for other credit-based services.

# How Credit Card Default Happens?
When you accept a credit card, you agree to certain terms. For example, you agree to make your minimum payment by the due date listed on your credit card statement. If you miss the minimum payment six months in a row, your credit card will be in default. Your credit card issuer will likely close your account and report the default to the credit bureaus.
